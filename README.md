# Teaching Dimesnion of Linear Threshold Functions.

Teaching Dimension is a machine learning theory concept defined as:

```the minimum sample size required if a teacher were to select training examples for a given ERM learning algorithm with a given cost function.```[^1]

Project background and description available on my [blog](hanqizhang.github.io/posts/2020/06/blog-post-1/). 

The simulation code here empirically tests the relationship between the dimension of the dataset and the optimal teaching set size.
